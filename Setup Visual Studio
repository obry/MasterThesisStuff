#What is needed to do before you can successfully compile /DIM_server_GC_final/Source.cpp

download http://dim.web.cern.ch/dim/dim_v20r7.zip
and extract somewhere.
There will be a Folder "dim_vxxxx" with version number xxxx. (I used "dim_20r7").

In Visual Studio create a new Project of "Application Type" "Console application".
Check "Additional options" "Empty project".
Create and open the Project.

In Visual Studio open the Project's Propeties with eiterh Alt+F or the tab "Project/'projectname' Properties".
From there you go to
"/Configuration Properties/VC++ Directories/"
and add to
"/General/Include Directories" the path to "dim_xxxx\dim"
e.g. "C:\dim_v20r7\dim"
and add to
"/General/Library Directories" the path to "dim_xxxx\bin32".

Go to 
"/Configuration Properties/Linker/Input"
edit
"Additional Dependencies"
and type there "dim.lib".

/DIM_server_GC_final/Source.cpp should now compile successfully
